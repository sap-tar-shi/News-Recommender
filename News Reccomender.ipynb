      "People who were stranded at sea aboard Barge P305 due to Cyclone Tauktae exit the Indian Naval Ship (INS) Kochi after they were rescued by the Indian Navy, at Naval Dockyard, Mumbai, India, May 19, 2021.\n",
      "REUTERS/Francis Mascarenhas India's army and navy deployed ships and aircraft as they searched for 26 people still missing more than three days after a powerful cyclone sank a barge off the country's west coast, killing 49 people on board.\n",
      "Cyclone Tauktae, the most powerful storm to barrel into the west coast in two decades, has killed at least 46 others after wreaking havoc in the states of Gujarat, Maharashtra, Goa, Karnataka and Kerala.\n",
      "\"Ships and aircraft continue to search for the remaining crew,\" Navy spokesman Mehul Karnik said in a statement on Thursday evening.\n",
      "Five rescued workers taken to Mumbai's Apollo Spectra hospital were in stable condition, a hospital spokesman said.\n",
      "\"As the barge started to sink, my nephew jumped into the sea and stayed in the water for nine hours until the navy came to his rescue,\" said Sanjay More, a relative of one survivor.\n",
      "Rajnish Singh, the relative of another, told Reuters that all the workers on board had lost their mobile phones but that he had seen footage of his brother being rescued on television and knew he was safe.\n",
      "The barge was owned and operated by Durmast Enterprises and was chartered by Afcons Infrastructure Limited, a construction and engineering company based in Mumbai and engaged in contract work for Oil and Natural Gas Corp.\n",
      "\"Durmast is the owner and the responsibility for marine operations rests with the vessel owner and his marine crew stationed on the vessel,\" Afcons said in a statement, adding that its construction workmen were on the barge.\n",
      "Reuters provides business, financial, national and international news to professionals via desktop terminals, the world's media organizations, industry events and directly to consumers.\n",
